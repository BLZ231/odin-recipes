    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Honestly I don't know what to <strong>put here.</strong> 
        I vaguely remember liking these as a kid, so I tried
    googling for the recipe and was surprised that I was able to find
it. Kind of obscure, but I figured it would work for this</p>
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup peanut butter</li>
<li>1/2 cup honey</li>
<li>1/2 cup confectioner's sugar</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>Milk chocolate morsels</li>
<li>1/4 cup sweet cocoa</li>

<!--The original recipe came from a Winnie the Pooh
themed version of Candyland-->


</ul>

<p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure the peanut butter and honey are
        at room temperature.
    </li>
    <li>Mix the peanut butter, honey, and vanilla extract 
        until all the ingredients are blended smooth.
    </li>
    <li>Continue to mix the ingredients while gradually
        adding the confectioner's sugar a bit at a time until
        it's all blended smooth.
    </li>
    <li>Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or until the dough
        has slightly stiffened.
    </li>
    <li>Place the sweetened cocoa in another small bowl.</li>
    <li>Use a teaspoon to scoop out a bit of dough, place 2 or 3
         milk chocolate morsels in the center, and roll it into
         a ball.
    </li>
    <li>Drop the ball of dough into the bowl of cocoa and roll
        it around until it is completely coated.
    </li>
    <li>Repeat the previous two steps until all the dough
        has been used up.
    </li>
    <li>Place the truffles on a plate and keep them in the
        refrigerator for 2 hours or until the truffles have
        slightly hardened.
    </li>
